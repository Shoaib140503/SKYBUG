Hello there, This is one of the three projects for my AI internship at SkyBug Technologies. 
Dataset used is "TMDB 5000 movies" along with their credits dataset. Those are not uploaded in this repo but you can download it from kaggle
There was one more ".pkl" file which contained cosine similarity value of each movie with every other movie. This file very crucial to have in order to run the code.
Since, the size of the file was more than 100MB, it didn't got uploaded into this repository.
But, if you have the dataset, you can create the ".pkl" files by following the code in "movies.ipynb" file.
